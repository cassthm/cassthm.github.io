I’m **Cassandra Tan Hui Ming**, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at **Singapore Management University (SMU)**.  
My research focuses on **memory-augmented large language models (LLMs)**—how to design systems that can accumulate, organize, and use knowledge across time. I am particularly interested in bridging ideas from **cognitive memory models** with modern **agentic LLM architectures**.

## Research Interests
- Memory-augmented generation for long-term reasoning  
- Agentic systems with structured, adaptive memory  
- Cognitive and ART-inspired retrieval mechanisms  

## Thesis (in progress)
**Value-Driven Memory-Augmented Generation for Agentic LLMs: Towards Structured and Adaptive Knowledge Utilization**  
My dissertation explores methods to integrate **persistent, structured memory** into LLMs, enabling them to reason across extended time horizons and adapt knowledge use by task value.  

## Academic Background
- Ph.D. in Computer Science (2024-present), Singapore Management University  
- Master of Science (Data Science), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia
- Bachelor of Science (Mathematics Technology) with Honours, majoring in Computation, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia

## Goals
I aim to build LLM-based systems that combine **scalability, adaptability, and reliability**—moving toward models that can support sustained, trustworthy collaboration with humans.
